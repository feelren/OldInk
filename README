    I create this project for my friend`s studio using semantics, BEM, SCSS, GRID, FLEX and JS. There is some kind of site-layout, which i`m looking at: 'https://oldink.ru/'. 
  The first version of this landing was made in Adobe Muse and didn`t have any adaptivity or optimization. 
  Code was non-supporting, that`s why i decided to remake it using actual web-developing skills.
